main act.
- can login and sign up properly 
  - calls from database to check on inputs
- i left the view all button there to see my data values, because i still can't fuckin find the .db file and idk how its annoying

sign up act.
- same verifications from hw1, but compares usernames to DB and puts all values (except confirm pw) into db
- takes you back to main act.

haven't implemented the splashes just yet
